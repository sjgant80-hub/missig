# missig — agent instructions

Miss-signature — foldsig's shadow. Records a fold that did NOT take (a rejected attempt), content-addressed with why it missed, so a loop learns from failure and never re-attempts a known-doomed fold.

## Boundaries

- Keep missig zero-dependency and deterministic. Do not add runtime dependencies.
- Every change to a source line must be covered by a test that fails when the line changes (witness gate).
- Do not skip, disable, or weaken a test to make the suite green. Fix the code or the test's premise.
- Structure and behaviour are gated by konomify; a change ships only when it stays konomified.
